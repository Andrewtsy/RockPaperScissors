# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a demo of the Rock Paper Scissors Game.

It contains three scripts that approach the task in three different ways, in order to highlight the multiple ways a project can be attacked.

## Simple

This script uses a series of nested if-else statements to generate win/loss/ties.

## Advanced

This script requires a little bit of knowledge on dot and cross product of vectors.
It also uses the numpy library which may need to be installed before running (pip should do it).

If nothing else, this should provide an interesting look at a different take on the Rock Paper Scissors Game.

## Wildcard

This script is very simple and kind of cheating.

I thought I'd include it anyway, just for fun.



### Have Fun!
